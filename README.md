  <p><code>Cyber</code></p>
I'm an undergraduate cybersecurity student at MSU Denver. I have an interest iin defensive security and want to work in IT or as a SOC analyst.

For the past two years, I've been working as a SOC analyst with the Centurion Program. I've been involved in monitoring and analyzing the infrastructure of the local government and small organizations. To complement the defensive mindset required for cyber analysis, I'm currently teaching myself offensive security (mostly web application stuff) with TryHackMe and PortSwigger Academy. I've also been supplementing my SOC work with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft EDR/XDR tools through their free learning program.
